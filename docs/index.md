```

### Basic Usage
```python
import mz_max as mz

# Load and explore data
data = mz.load_dataset('iris')

# Automated machine learning
automl = mz.AutoML()
model = automl.fit(data)
predictions = model.predict(new_data)

# Model evaluation
metrics = mz.evaluate_model(model, test_data)
print(f"Accuracy: {metrics['accuracy']:.4f}")
```
